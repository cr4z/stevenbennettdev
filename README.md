# Welcome to stevenbennett.dev

I have poured my heart and soul into creating a captivating user experience with this website. Among my proudest features are:
* The sidebar, which is actually 100% mobile-friendly ensuring that mobile users are still empowered with a seamless user experience!
* The parallax scroll effect on the header, which adds a touch of elegance that scales perfectly across all screen sizes.
* A small yet powerful component-based design system built on top of MUI.
* The search components; which boast a clever separation of between SearchControls and SearchResultsView to enhance reusability!

But I have more plans for this website than only what's seen now, such as adding more projects to showcase more of my ability, and I will even be integrating a fully custom-built blog section to discuss the things in development I constantly get to learn about with all those interested! Stay tuned for updates.
